# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# amine = User.create!(name: 'Amine', email: 'amine@mail.com', password: '123456')

# recipe1 = Recipe.create!(user_id: amine.id, name: 'Recipe1', preparation_time: 45, cooking_time: 60, description: 'description1', public: false)

# recipeFood1 = RecipeFood.create!(quantity: 5, food_id: 1, recipe_id: 1)
